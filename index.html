        <p>Earth—our home planet—is the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.</p>
        <p>Earth is the home-world of the human species and all known life forms. It is also perhaps the most unique planet that we know of. Not only is it home to life, but it also has a rather strange atmosphere and a surface covered in liquid water. When viewed from space, the Earth stands out as an oasis against the vast emptiness of space</p>
        <p>Earth is the fifth-largest planet in the solar system and the largest of the inner rocky worlds. The Earth is 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers) in diameter. It is 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away from the sun, or what astronomers call an astronomical unit. The average surface temperature on Earth is a moderate 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius), allowing for the existence of liquid water on the surface. Acceleration due to the Earth's gravitational force is 9.81 m/s^2 (32.2 ft/s^2), meaning that objects will fall at a rate of 9.81 meters for every second they drop. Earth's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen, with nitrogen comprising 78% of the atmosphere and oxygen 21%. The remaining 1% is a combination of several other elements and compounds, the most notable of which are argon, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane.</p>

        <p>The Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, shortly after the sun's birth. Out of the stardust that created the sun, a vast disk of material emerged called a protoplanetary disk. Gas and dust gradually coalesced together within this disk to form small objects called planetesimals. In terms of size, a planetesimal is similar to an asteroid or comet, yet its composition is like a miniature planet. Over millions of years, enough planetesimals will combine to form a small planet. As the planet grows more massive, its gravitational pull grows in strength, allowing the forming planet to bring in more material and grow even larger. The process becomes exponential until there is no more material to collect, and a planet is born. This is how the Earth likely formed. </p>
        <p>After Earth's formation, it was a harsh environment with no water or oxygen, and life hadn't yet taken hold. For the first few hundred million years, volcanic eruptions covered the planet in magma. During the Late Heavy Bombardment, asteroids continued to impact the surface. Despite these challenges, Earth quickly became habitable, with the earliest evidence of life appearing between four to three billion years ago. </p>
